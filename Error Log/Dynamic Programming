1. Climbing Stairs Problem 
  edge case, reach at N-1 Stair, return +1 (only one way to reach at Nth stair, there will not be a N+2th jump)
  
  tabulation
  class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int [] dp = new int[n+1];
        for(int i=0;i<=n;i++) dp[i]=-1;
        dp[n]=+1;      //base case
        dp[n-1]=+1;
        for(int i=n-2;i>=0;i--){     //iteration
            dp[i]=dp[i+1]+dp[i+2];
        }
        return dp[0];
    }
  }
2.House Robber Problem MAX(ROB,SKIP) - non adjacent elements sub sequence maximum sum
cannot use bit manipulation to generate all subsequences - computationally expensive
houses = 100 
subsequence  = 0 to 2^100-1 (31 digit number)

dp - do not use contraint based approach
constraint based (complicated approach) - i can not rob the adjacent house
dp[i]= cash[i] + max (dp[0],dp[1],.....,dp[i-2])  state = robbing the ith house, getting cash pile from i-2th prev houses.
