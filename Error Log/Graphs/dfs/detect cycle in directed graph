error log: track unique nodes for dfs calls, we use visited array
for saving recursive stack calls node path, use a path array - this will help detect cycle

we cannot use visited array for detecting cycle because, one node can be approachable from two different paths and still not form a cycle in a directed graph

  a->C
  b->C

  c is mergning point from two different paths, so its not a cycle because different paths
