1. Sorting + Two Pointers (j (i+1) & k(n-1)) for each i
2. avoiding duplicate triplets
  1. next i-> i++ until i is same as previous (same i gives same triplets j,k on its right)
  2. one i,j,k triplet when total==0, do j++ until j is same as previous (i fixed, same j will give sams triplets k on its right)
