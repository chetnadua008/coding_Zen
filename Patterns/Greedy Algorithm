Assign Cookies  
g[i] = green of children (it will not accept a cookie with size less than its greed)
s[i] = size of a cookie
goal to maximize the number of children that gets a cookie

greedy - give smallest satisfying cookie to child with minimum greed level
we do sorting of cookiesize and green then use two pointers 
if(greed[i]<=size[j]){
  i++;
  j++
}  ..child statisfied
else j++; ..cookie j is not given to any child
